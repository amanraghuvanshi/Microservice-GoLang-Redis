# **Go Language Mircoservice API**

<hr>

**Since, we all know that go lang is a super light weight programming langauge.**

**We can also build command line tools, microservices and others**

**We are going to make a API that will be connected to Redis Database and then we can spin that API to get our job done**

# **Configuration Files**

**Run go mod tidy and get all the dependencies**

# **Working with the file**

1. **Building the webserver to serve the request**
    * First step is to initialize the server, so that we can accept and server the request.

2. **Routing**

    * **Currently we are only working with the basic operations like updations and all, later on depending on the need we will be adding more funtionality on the top**

3. **Redis**

    * **In this project we going to utlize the `Redis` Database as our datastore, which is basically a in-memory datastore and because of that Redis is quite fast**
